# This project will cover TDD: Test Driven Developement :taco:

## Two frameworks:
- Unittest
- Pytest


Benefits of TDD:
- Simple code
- Atomic
- Code specs
- Know when you're done (more important for outsourcing/ projects work)
- Maintainability & reduce technical debt (more important for internal work)
